							<h2>Our Purpose</h2>
 <img src="images/fist.jpg" width="300" height="285" alt="Protest fist">
 <p>YEJ PAC is a nonpartisan Political Action Committee (PAC) involved in influencing the outcome of elections that will impact students and our communities quality of life.</p>
 
<p>Contributions are used to support candidates and political causes that will advocate for loan forgiveness, police accountability, economic development, and someone who will protect jobs for the working poor.</p>

<p>Investing in the YEJ PAC provides an avenue for students who are overburden with student loan debt to have a greater impact on legislative campaigns.</p> 

<p>The PAC has made it a priority to help elect local and national candidates who truly understand the need to support loan forgiveness and economic development â€“ and defeat those who do not. Acting alone it is extremely difficult for an individual business to make a political impact. YEJ PAC offers college students organized political action to elect candidates who advocate policies that ensure students have loan forgiveness upon completing college, police accountability, economic certainty and stability for students interested in job creation.</p>
